## B1 course package contract (v1), Release 0 foundation

Files: `contracts/course-package.v1.schema.json`, `contracts/examples/course-package.v1/`,
`libs/contracts/tests/test_course_package_v1.py`; the package validator in `libs/contracts/*.py`
(shared validator reference EXT-09: the schema stage, idnumbers unique within one package, and
configured protected idnumbers) with its tests `test_validate_course.py`, `test_config.py` and
`test_report.py`. B1 has no requirement ID of its own in the PRD (it is a contract, PRD B.0), so
no row in the table above maps to it.

FR-S-03 ("Validate against B1 and the checker rule library", Release 2) is deliberately not in the
table above. The tests below cover only the B1-related part of it: structure checks against the
schema. They do not implement FR-S-03, which also needs the checker rule library (Module 2) and
validation on every save in Course Studio. FR-S-03 gets its row in the pull request that
implements it.

### Enforced by the JSON Schema and covered by automated tests

Structure only. Test names are in `test_course_package_v1.py`.

| Rule | PRD | Test(s) |
|---|---|---|
| `schema` equals `learnops.course/v1`; `course` and `sections` required | B1.1 | `test_missing_required_field_is_rejected`, `test_wrong_type_or_value_is_rejected` |
| Required fields and types on course, section and activity (`type`, `idnumber`, `title`; section `number`, `activities`) | B1.1 | same two tests |
| `mode` is `full` or `sections-only` | B1.1, B1.4 | `test_wrong_type_or_value_is_rejected`, `test_example_in_sections_only_mode_is_valid` |
| `slug`, `idnumber` and `unlock.after` are lowercase ASCII with hyphens (format only, not uniqueness) | B1.1, B1.2 rule 6 | `test_invalid_identifier_is_rejected` |
| The two default protected idnumbers (`final-project`, `course-feedback`) are rejected on sections and activities, in both modes | B1.4 | `test_protected_idnumber_is_rejected` |
| An assignment has `body`, `points`, `submission` and `completion`; a page has `body` | B1.1 | `test_missing_required_field_is_rejected` |
| `unlock.start_date` is an ISO date string or null (impossible dates are rejected; an unquoted YAML date is rejected) | B1.1 | `test_invalid_start_date_is_rejected`, `test_unquoted_yaml_date_is_rejected_so_it_must_be_quoted` |
| An H5P activity has `graded: false` | B7 | `test_missing_required_field_is_rejected`, `test_wrong_type_or_value_is_rejected` |
| Unknown fields are accepted | B.0 rule 2, EXT-02 | `test_valid_variation_is_accepted` |
| The schema is valid, and the example package validates (also as `sections-only`) | B.0 rule 1 | `test_schema_is_a_valid_draft_2020_12_schema`, `test_example_package_is_valid`, `test_example_in_sections_only_mode_is_valid` |

Enforced and tested, but chosen in the schema rather than stated as a rule in the PRD (to be
confirmed by the contract reviewers): the `type` spellings `url` and `label`; `completion` limited
to `submit`; `submission` limited to `onlinetext` and `file`; `section.number` at least 1; points
as non-negative integers; non-empty titles; the shape of `body` (relative path, no `..`);
`activities` and `sections` not empty.

### Enforced by validator code (`libs/contracts`) and covered by automated tests

`validate_course_document()` runs the schema on a parsed `course.yaml`, then (when the structure
is valid) the idnumber rules, and returns a report. Settings come in through `ValidationConfig`;
the library reads no environment variables. Test names are in `test_validate_course.py`
(course.yaml as parsed data), `test_config.py` (the settings object) and `test_report.py` (the
report types).

**B1.2 rule 6 has two halves, and only the first is enforced.** The validator checks that
`idnumber`s are unique *within the one package it is given*. It does not check that an idnumber is
*never reused for a different activity* across package versions: that needs information about the
previous version of the package and an owner that is not assigned yet (Studio's design proposes a
comparison with the previous version, `docs/design/studio.md` §5 "Identity", which is a
proposal and not decided). Every
report lists that half as not checked (`idnumber_reuse_not_checked`). Rule 6 is therefore not
claimed as fully implemented.

| Rule | PRD | Test(s) |
|---|---|---|
| The schema is applied to a parsed `course.yaml`; every error is reported (not only the first), in a fixed order by place (list positions in numeric order: `sections[2]` before `sections[10]`), with its place, a message and a fix hint; an impossible calendar date and a document that is not an object are errors | B.0 rule 4, B1.1 | `test_example_document_has_no_errors`, `test_schema_errors_are_reported_with_their_place`, `test_every_schema_error_is_reported_not_only_the_first`, `test_errors_are_ordered_by_number_not_by_text`, `test_an_impossible_calendar_date_is_rejected`, `test_a_document_that_is_not_an_object_is_an_error` |
| The two default protected idnumbers are rejected with a clear message that names the place and says what to do; the validator reports each one once | B1.4 | `test_default_protected_idnumbers_are_left_to_the_schema`, `test_default_protected_idnumber_gets_a_clear_message` |
| **Uniqueness within one package** (first half of rule 6): `idnumber`s are unique in the `course.yaml` being checked. Sections and activities share one namespace. The later use in document order is the error, with its exact place, and the message names the first use. Reported in both modes. Two different duplicated ids are reported in document order | B1.2 rule 6 | `test_duplicate_idnumber_is_an_error_at_the_later_use` (7 cases, each with the exact error place and first-use place, including an activity reusing an earlier or a later section id), `test_an_idnumber_used_three_times_is_reported_for_each_extra_use`, `test_two_different_duplicated_ids_are_both_reported_in_document_order`, `test_similar_idnumbers_are_not_duplicates`, `test_duplicate_idnumbers_are_an_error_in_sections_only_mode_too` |
| **Not enforced: reuse across package versions** (second half of rule 6) is listed in every report as `idnumber_reuse_not_checked`, with a message that says why (it needs the previous version of the package) | B1.2 rule 6 | `test_cross_version_reuse_of_idnumbers_is_listed_as_not_checked`, `test_held_rules_are_reported_as_not_checked_never_skipped_silently` |
| Protected idnumbers a site adds to the two defaults are rejected on sections and activities, in both modes, with the exact place, the idnumber and a fix hint. They add to the defaults and never replace them, are matched exactly, and several can be configured. The result does not depend on the order in which they were given | B1.4 | `test_configured_protected_idnumber_is_rejected_in_both_modes`, `test_the_library_reads_no_environment_variables` (also: not protected unless configured), `test_only_an_exact_match_is_protected`, `test_several_configured_ids_are_each_rejected_in_document_order`, `test_protected_and_duplicate_problems_are_both_reported`, `test_a_default_protected_id_is_always_rejected_and_reported_once` |
| `ValidationConfig` accepts a collection of valid idnumbers and keeps its own immutable `frozenset` copy (later changes to the caller's collection do not reach it; equal configurations hash alike). It refuses with a `ConfigError` that says what to fix: a bare string or bytes (which would be read one character at a time), `None` or any non-collection, a mapping, a member that is not text, and an invalid idnumber (the first bad one in sorted order is named) | B1.4 | `test_config.py`: `test_default_configuration_adds_no_protected_idnumbers`, `test_several_configured_ids_are_kept_and_the_same_id_twice_counts_once`, `test_any_collection_of_idnumbers_is_stored_as_a_frozenset`, `test_the_configuration_cannot_be_changed_after_creation`, `test_changing_the_callers_collection_later_does_not_change_the_configuration`, `test_equal_configurations_are_equal_and_hash_alike_whatever_they_were_built_from`, `test_a_configured_idnumber_must_be_a_valid_idnumber`, `test_a_bad_idnumber_message_names_the_value_and_what_to_do`, `test_something_that_is_not_a_collection_of_idnumbers_is_refused`, `test_a_member_that_is_not_text_is_refused` |
| `validate_course_document()` refuses a `config` that is not a `ValidationConfig` (a dict, a list, a string, the class itself) with a `ConfigError` that says what to pass, before the document is read; it never ignores it | B1.4 | `test_an_unsupported_config_type_is_refused_not_ignored` |
| The library reads no environment variables; validation does not change the document it is given | CLAUDE.md §2.3 | `test_the_library_reads_no_environment_variables`, `test_the_document_is_not_changed_by_validation` |
| The idnumber rules run only when the schema finds no error anywhere in the document (an unrelated schema error holds them back too, and so does a document that is not an object). The report then adds `cross_rules_not_checked`, whose text names no rule so that it stays true as more rules are implemented | n/a | `test_any_schema_error_holds_back_the_idnumber_rules`, `test_a_document_that_is_not_an_object_is_an_error` (also checks the notice), `test_the_course_level_notice_names_no_rule` (a valid document has no such notice: `test_held_rules_are_reported_as_not_checked_never_skipped_silently`) |
| Rules that are not implemented are listed as "not checked" in every report, so that "no errors" is not read as "fully checked" (a design choice, not a PRD rule). Nine are listed now (see the next section). One is `body_files_not_checked` (B1.1): the validator reads no files, so a `body` naming a missing file is not an error here; checking it needs the package folder and belongs to 3/3 | n/a | `test_held_rules_are_reported_as_not_checked_never_skipped_silently`, `test_a_document_with_weekly_structure_problems_is_not_judged_here`, `test_body_files_are_listed_as_not_checked_and_never_looked_for` |
| A report is ok when it has no errors; "not checked" entries do not make it fail; issues cannot be changed after creation | n/a | `test_empty_report_is_ok`, `test_report_with_an_error_is_not_ok`, `test_not_checked_items_do_not_make_a_report_fail`, `test_issue_defaults_are_a_document_level_issue`, `test_issue_cannot_be_changed_after_creation` |

This is not FR-S-03 or FR-C-03: the checker's rules (CK-xx) work on the course model (B2), which
this library does not build.

### Documented but not automatically enforced

Nothing in the repository enforces these yet. Each is listed as "not checked" in every report the
validator returns (nine entries; the B1.3 row has two of them, and rule 4 has none because it is
not a package field).
The schema's `$comment` lists them too, and also lists the two parts that the validator now
enforces (rule 6 within one package, configured protected idnumbers). Updating that comment
needs a separate contract-change review and is not part of this change. The example package was
checked against these rules by hand when it was created; that check is not automated and is not
committed.

| Rule | PRD | Where the PRD places it |
|---|---|---|
| One guide Page and one task Assignment per week | B1.2 rule 1 | No checker rule is named for it (CK-01…CK-13) |
| Week N unlocks when the week N-1 task is submitted; `unlock.after` names an existing earlier activity | B1.2 rule 2 | Related: CK-04, CK-05 (FR-C-03, R1) |
| Graded points sum to `total_points` | B1.2 rule 3 | CK-03 |
| Assignments use marking workflow | B1.2 rule 4 | CK-10 (not a package field) |
| Completion tracking on for every activity used in an unlock rule | B1.2 rule 5 | CK-13 |
| An `idnumber` is never reused for a different activity (listed as `idnumber_reuse_not_checked`; uniqueness within one package is enforced above) | B1.2 rule 6, second half | The PRD states this rule. It cannot be judged from one `course.yaml`: it needs the previous package version, and no owner or checker is assigned yet (CK-06 covers duplicate or invalid idnumbers in the course model only) |
| The file named by each `body` exists in the package folder (listed as `body_files_not_checked`) | B1.1 | Implied by "a folder containing `course.yaml` plus Markdown files", not a numbered rule. Needs the package folder, so it is for 3/3 |
| Marking table present and valid: markers, columns, points sum, allowed `Check` names | B1.3, C3.5 | CK-09 |
| `protected_section` collision (configured protected idnumbers are enforced above) | B1.4 | `protected_section` has no default in the PRD; CK-07 covers the course model |

### Not mapped

Left out because the PRD does not establish the mapping:

- **A row, demo step and Bloom level for FR-S-03.** See the note at the top of this section. PRD
  C1.12 gives levels to kinds of work (for example "Design (L6): schema, validator, generator"),
  not to individual requirements.
- **FR-S-02, FR-S-04, FR-S-07, FR-S-08, FR-C-01, FR-G-01.** They touch B1 but need code that does
  not exist yet, and the PRD does not say that schema tests count towards them.
- **C1.7 "a package containing a protected idnumber is rejected with a clear message".** The
  validator reports the two default idnumbers with a clear message (tested above); the Course
  Studio screen and CLI that show it do not exist yet.
- **Requirement IDs for the contract work itself.** None in the PRD.

## B8.6 model comparison set (PROVISIONAL), Release 0 foundation

Files: `testdata/b8-6-model-comparison/` (manifest, rubric, three schemas, one transcript input,
two expected outputs), `libs/contracts/tests/test_b8_6_dataset.py`. B8.6 is a test-data set
(PRD B8) with no requirement ID of its own. It is the input of FR-M-03 (Release 4), which is not
implemented, so no row in the table above maps to it.

### Covered by automated tests

| Rule | Source | Test(s) |
|---|---|---|
| Manifest, rubric and expected chapters validate against their schemas | Proposed format (set README, O10) | `test_schema_is_a_valid_draft_2020_12_schema`, `test_manifest_and_rubric_are_valid`, `test_expected_chapters_are_valid_and_fit_the_transcript` |
| Fixed inputs linked to expected outputs; pending and placeholder items hold no content | PRD B8 | `test_ids_are_unique_and_references_resolve`, `test_pending_and_placeholder_items_have_no_content` |
| Transcript input has the B5.4 shape and consistent times | PRD B5.4 | `test_transcript_has_the_prd_b5_4_shape_and_consistent_times`, `test_time_checks_catch_bad_transcripts`, `test_transcript_validates_against_the_b5_contract` (skipped until B5 is on `main`) |
| Expected chapters use the B6.2 shape and fit the transcript | PRD B6.2 | `test_expected_chapters_are_valid_and_fit_the_transcript`, `test_chapter_checks_catch_overlap` |
| The four FR-M-03 measures are in the rubric | PRD FR-M-03 | `test_rubric_covers_the_measures_and_tasks` |
| Provisional and not-reviewed labelling; no results claimed | Set README | `test_status_rules`, `test_reviewed_needs_a_reviewer`, `test_expected_summary_is_labelled_until_reviewed`, `test_no_results_are_claimed` |
| No real data (fictional hosts only, no email addresses, small text files) | PRD B8, C-07 | `test_files_are_small_text_with_no_real_hosts_or_email_addresses` |

### Not met yet, and not tested

- Grading-draft items (wait for B8.4 and its reference grades, Q13) and practice items (Q12).
- Reviewed expected outputs, a fixed rubric (Q48), measure definitions marked `open`, set size.
- Any comparison run or result (FR-M-03, Release 4).
