## B1 course package contract (v1), Release 0 foundation

Files: `contracts/course-package.v1.schema.json`, `contracts/examples/course-package.v1/`,
`libs/contracts/tests/test_course_package_v1.py`. B1 has no requirement ID of its own in the PRD
(it is a contract, PRD B.0), so no row in the table above maps to it.

FR-S-03 ("Validate against B1 and the checker rule library", Release 2) is deliberately not in the
table above. The tests below cover only the B1-related part of it: structure checks against the
schema. They do not implement FR-S-03, which also needs the checker rule library (Module 2) and
validation on every save in Course Studio. FR-S-03 gets its row in the pull request that
implements it.

### Enforced by the JSON Schema and covered by automated tests

Structure only. Test names are in `test_course_package_v1.py`.

| Rule | PRD | Test(s) |
|---|---|---|
| `schema` equals `learnops.course/v1`; `course` and `sections` required | B1.1 | `test_missing_required_field_is_rejected`, `test_wrong_type_or_value_is_rejected` |
| Required fields and types on course, section and activity (`type`, `idnumber`, `title`; section `number`, `activities`) | B1.1 | same two tests |
| `mode` is `full` or `sections-only` | B1.1, B1.4 | `test_wrong_type_or_value_is_rejected`, `test_example_in_sections_only_mode_is_valid` |
| `slug`, `idnumber` and `unlock.after` are lowercase ASCII with hyphens (format only, not uniqueness) | B1.1, B1.2 rule 6 | `test_invalid_identifier_is_rejected` |
| The two default protected idnumbers (`final-project`, `course-feedback`) are rejected on sections and activities, in both modes | B1.4 | `test_protected_idnumber_is_rejected` |
| An assignment has `body`, `points`, `submission` and `completion`; a page has `body` | B1.1 | `test_missing_required_field_is_rejected` |
| `unlock.start_date` is an ISO date string or null (impossible dates are rejected; an unquoted YAML date is rejected) | B1.1 | `test_invalid_start_date_is_rejected`, `test_unquoted_yaml_date_is_rejected_so_it_must_be_quoted` |
| An H5P activity has `graded: false` | B7 | `test_missing_required_field_is_rejected`, `test_wrong_type_or_value_is_rejected` |
| Unknown fields are accepted | B.0 rule 2, EXT-02 | `test_valid_variation_is_accepted` |
| The schema is valid, and the example package validates (also as `sections-only`) | B.0 rule 1 | `test_schema_is_a_valid_draft_2020_12_schema`, `test_example_package_is_valid`, `test_example_in_sections_only_mode_is_valid` |

Enforced and tested, but chosen in the schema rather than stated as a rule in the PRD (to be
confirmed by the contract reviewers): the `type` spellings `url` and `label`; `completion` limited
to `submit`; `submission` limited to `onlinetext` and `file`; `section.number` at least 1; points
as non-negative integers; non-empty titles; the shape of `body` (relative path, no `..`);
`activities` and `sections` not empty.

### Documented but not automatically enforced

No validator code for these exists yet, so nothing in the repository checks them. The schema's
`$comment` lists them too. The example package was checked against them by hand when it was
created; that check is not automated and is not committed.

| Rule | PRD | Where the PRD places it |
|---|---|---|
| One guide Page and one task Assignment per week | B1.2 rule 1 | No checker rule is named for it (CK-01…CK-13) |
| Week N unlocks when the week N-1 task is submitted; `unlock.after` names an existing earlier activity | B1.2 rule 2 | Related: CK-04, CK-05 (FR-C-03, R1) |
| Graded points sum to `total_points` | B1.2 rule 3 | CK-03 |
| Assignments use marking workflow | B1.2 rule 4 | CK-10 (not a package field) |
| Completion tracking on for every activity used in an unlock rule | B1.2 rule 5 | CK-13 |
| `idnumber`s unique within the course and never reused for a different activity | B1.2 rule 6 | CK-06 (uniqueness); "never reused" has no PRD rule |
| Marking table present and valid: markers, columns, points sum, allowed `Check` names | B1.3, C3.5 | CK-09 |
| Protected idnumbers configured beyond the two defaults; `protected_section` collision | B1.4 | CK-07 for the course model; `protected_section` has no default in the PRD |

### Not mapped

Left out because the PRD does not establish the mapping:

- **A row, demo step and Bloom level for FR-S-03.** See the note at the top of this section. PRD
  C1.12 gives levels to kinds of work (for example "Design (L6): schema, validator, generator"),
  not to individual requirements.
- **FR-S-02, FR-S-04, FR-S-07, FR-S-08, FR-C-01, FR-G-01.** They touch B1 but need code that does
  not exist yet, and the PRD does not say that schema tests count towards them.
- **C1.7 "a package containing a protected idnumber is rejected with a clear message".** The schema
  rejects the two default idnumbers; the user-facing message is not tested.
- **Requirement IDs for the contract work itself.** None in the PRD.

## B6 lesson manifest contract (v1), Release 0 foundation

Files: `contracts/lesson-manifest.v1.schema.json`, `contracts/examples/lesson-manifest.v1/`
(`single-track/lesson.json`, `camera-screen/lesson.json`),
`libs/contracts/tests/test_lesson_manifest_v1.py`. B6 has no requirement ID of its own in the PRD
(it is a contract, PRD B.0), so no row in the table above maps to it.

FR-V-08 ("Write `lesson.json` (B6.3) last, only when all required files exist", Release 3) is
deliberately not in the table above. The tests below cover only the schema that FR-V-08 and the
C4.7 criterion "`lesson.json` validates against B6.3" will be checked against. FR-V-08 gets its row
in the pull request that implements it.

### Enforced by the JSON Schema and covered by automated tests

Structure only. Test names are in `test_lesson_manifest_v1.py`.

| Rule | PRD | Test(s) |
|---|---|---|
| `schema` equals `learnops.lesson/v1` | B6.3 | `test_missing_required_field_is_rejected`, `test_wrong_type_or_value_is_rejected` |
| `tracks`, `captions`, `transcript`, `chapters` required (they point to files B6.2 marks required) | B6.2, B6.3 | `test_missing_required_field_is_rejected`, `test_wrong_type_or_value_is_rejected` |
| At least one `main` track; track roles are `main`, `main-low`, `camera`, `screen` | B6.2, B6.3 | `test_invalid_track_is_rejected`, `test_examples_use_every_track_role` |
| A single-track lesson stays valid when `camera` and `screen` tracks are added | C4.7, EXT-03 | `test_single_track_lesson_stays_valid_with_camera_and_screen_added` |
| Every path is relative to the lesson folder: not a URL, not absolute, no `..` segment | B6.3, C-08 | `test_path_that_is_not_relative_is_rejected` |
| `course_slug` is lowercase ASCII with hyphens | B6.1 | `test_invalid_course_slug_is_rejected` |
| Unknown fields are accepted | B.0 rule 2, EXT-02 | `test_valid_variation_is_accepted` |
| The schema is valid; both examples and the PRD B6.3 example validate | B.0 rule 1 | `test_schema_is_a_valid_draft_2020_12_schema`, `test_example_manifest_is_valid`, `test_prd_example_is_valid` |

Enforced and tested, but chosen in the schema rather than stated as a rule in the PRD (to be
confirmed by the contract reviewers): `course_slug`, `lesson_id`, `title`, `duration_s`, `source`
and `processing` are optional; `track.role` is a closed list of the four roles named in B6.2/B6.3;
`source.kind` is required inside `source` but is any non-empty string (the PRD names only
`upload`); `captions` not empty; `height` a positive integer; `duration_s` a non-negative number;
`processing.completed_at` an RFC 3339 timestamp with a time zone; non-empty strings.

### Documented but not automatically enforced

| Rule | PRD | Where the PRD places it |
|---|---|---|
| The files the manifest names, and `poster.jpg`, exist in the lesson folder | B6.2 | FR-V-08 (R3) |
| `lesson.json` written last, only when all required files exist | B6.2 | FR-V-08 (R3) |
| `course_slug` and `lesson_id` match the folder's place in the path template | B6.1 | `libs/media_paths` (Release 0, separate pull request) |
| Calendar validity of `processing.completed_at` (for example no 31 February) | — | Only with a `date-time` format checker (`rfc3339-validator`, not installed in CI) |
| Shapes of `transcript.en.json`, `chapters.json`, `slides.json`, `cues.json` | B6.2 | No schema yet |
